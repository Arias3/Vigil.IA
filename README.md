# DESCRIPTION ðŸ“–

This document provides a comprehensive overview of Vigil.IA, a real-time drowsiness detection system that combines computer vision, machine learning, and web technologies to monitor driver alertness. The system captures video frames from a user's camera, processes them through deep learning models, and provides immediate visual and audio feedback about drowsiness levels.

For detailed information about specific components, see: Frontend Architecture (#2), Backend Architecture (#3), Real-Time Processing Pipeline (#4), and Development and Testing (#5).
